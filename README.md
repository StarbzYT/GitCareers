<p>Using <a href="https://www.figma.com/" title="Figma Site">Figma</a>, the team orchestrated an <strong>online white-board session</strong> to organize everyone's thoughts into one common goal to prevent creative collisions later on. The <em>"How Might We" Wall</em> stirred conversations on potential methods to create page layouts, functionality, and styling, while the <em>Project Map</em> concentrated on specific components and page-flow (application links, and other user-specifications). It also served as various <em>tickets</em> for the team's developers to complete!</p>

<p>The team's designer made feasible wireframes to pull everything together into a final product. Responsive design was kept in mind throughout the process and tickets for various features were finalized. This helped everyone think about which CSS tools would compliment the design's colour pallet/theme.</p>
